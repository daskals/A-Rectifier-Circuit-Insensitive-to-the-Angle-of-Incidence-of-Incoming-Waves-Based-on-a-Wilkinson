# A Rectifier Circuit Insensitive to the Angle of Incidence of Incoming Waves Based on a Wilkinson Power Combiner
Design files of IEEE publication: A Rectifier Circuit Insensitive to the Angle of
Incidence of Incoming Waves Based on a Wilkinson
Power Combiner


In this repo, a novel high efficiency, low-cost and
low-complexity RF-to-dc converter was designed for RF energy
harvesting in the 2.4 GHz band. The proposed design has two
RF inputs and maintains a high efficiency over a wide range
of incoming incident wave angles. The circuit is based on a
Wilkinson power combiner and has two single-diode rectifiers.
One rectifier is connected at the combiner’s output and collects
the energy coming from the two inputs. The second rectifier
replaces the isolation resistor of the combiner in order to collect
the power that would otherwise be dissipated in it. The second
rectifier is used for recycling the wasted power when the input
signals do not have the same phase. The novel RF-to-dc converter
was fabricated using commercially available components and lowcost FR-4 substrate. 
A prototype was designed and its efficiency
was optimized for low power input levels. The measured system
efficiency was 16.2% for in-phase input signals with available
input power −17 dBm. When the relative phase of input signals
varied from 0 to 360 degrees, a variation in efficiency between
15.3% and 22% was observed. For input power 3 dBm, the
efficiency varies from 26% to 39% between 0 to 360 degrees
phase difference.
