Apostolos Georgiadis (S'94-M'02-SM'08) was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. He received the B.S. degree in physics and M.S. degree in telecommunications from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1993 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA, in 2002.

In 2002, he joined Global Communications Devices, North Andover, MA, USA, as a Systems Engineer where he involved in CMOS transceivers for wireless network applications. In 2003, he joined Bermai Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA, as an RF/Analog Systems Architect. In 2005, he joined the University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain, as a Juan de la Cierva Fellow Researcher. In 2006, he was a consultant for Bitwave Semiconductor, Lowell, MA, USA. He collaborated with ACORDE S.A., Santander, Spain, where he was involved in the design of integrated CMOS VCOs for ultra-wideband applications. In 2007, he joined the Technological Telecommunications Center of Catalonia (CTTC), Spain, as a Senior Researcher of communications subsystems. From 2013 to 2016, he was a Group Leader with the Microwave Systems and Nanotechnology Department, CTTC. In 2016, he joined Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K., as an Associate Professor. He has authored more than 180 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. His current research interests include energy harvesting and wireless power transmission, RFID technology, active antennas and phased-array antennas,inkjet and 3-D printed electronics, millimeter-wave systems.

Dr. Georgiadis was a recipient of the Fulbright Scholarship for graduate studies at the University of Massachusetts, in 1996. He was the General Chair of the 2011 IEEE RFID-TA Conference and the General Co-Chair of the 2011 IEEE MTT-S IMWS on Millimeter Wave Integration Technologies. He is an EU Marie Curie Global Fellow. He is member of the IEEE MTT-S TC-24 RFID Technologies (past Chair) and a member of the IEEE MTT-S TC-26 Wireless Energy Transfer and Conversion. He was an Associate Editor of the IET Microwaves Antennas and Propagation journal, IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS COMPONENTS LETTERS, and the IEEE RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) VIRTUAL JOURNAL. He serves as an Associate Editor for the IEEE JOURNAL OF RFID and is the Founder and the Editor-in-Chief of the Wireless Power Transfer Journal of Cambridge University Press. He is the Chair of the URSI Commission D, Electronics, and Photonics, and an AdCom member of the IEEE Council on RFID serving as the Vice President of conferences. He is a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Council on RFID. In 2016, his proposal for Inkjet/3-D printed millimeter-wave systems received the Bell Labs Prize, third place among more than 250 proposals recognizing ideas that ``change the game" in the field of information and communications technologies.
